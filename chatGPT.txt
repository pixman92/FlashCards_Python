python - use lots of comments. make it work for Python 2.7.10

create a script that has 3 modes, add cards, edit cards, delete cards, (ask for import of .dck file on every command option, no need for import option)

ask for input for a question and answer. keep the answers of strings in an array, within a main array, with the first index is the name of the deck. the file structure is like: 
example for a .dck file: (make the file a .dck file, but is filled with text)
and follow this pattern:
[[[answer, answer1],[question, question1]],[[answer, answer2], [question, question2]]]

after every card added, save to the data to a unique .dck file, with a filename based on the name given when choosing to add cards. store the card data as arrays in the .dck file

if either a question's or answer's recieved input is "", exit out of the adding cards mode and do not add the current card

study mode:
print out the question
on 'enter' key press, show the answer

ask if you got it correct, if correct, mark the question/answer array with a 'understood' tag. add that tag to the question/answer array
then take that card out of the circulation, but do not delete the card. keep asking all cards that are not labeled 'understood'

delete mode: deletes cards based on index given, not whole decks

add in an option to reset - so all 'understood' tags are removed, and all cards are back in play

add the option for importing a .dck file, by way of file path to a .dck file, take in a .dck file that is in the same directory as the compare.py script
when adding cards and the script asks for deck name to ask to add cards to, if that deck name is not found, create it!

structure the .dck file as an array, each question and answer text are arrays stored in a bigger array, and have another item in the array for the 'understood' tag

add an '\n' before questions, when they are printed
