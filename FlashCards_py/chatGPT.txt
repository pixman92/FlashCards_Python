python - use lots of comments. make it work for Python 2.7.10

create a script that has 3 modes, add cards, edit cards, delete cards,

ask for input for a question and answer. keep these strings in an array, within a main array, with the first index is the name of the deck

after every card added, save to the data to a .dck file

if either a question's or answer's recieved input is "", exit out of the adding cards mode and do not add the current card

study mode:
print out the question
on 'enter' key press, show the answer

ask if you got it correct, if correct, mark the question/answer array with a 'understood' tag.
then take that card out of the circulation

add in an option to reset - so all 'understood' tags are removed, and all cards are back in play
